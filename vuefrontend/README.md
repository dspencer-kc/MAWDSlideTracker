## Project setup
```
npm install
```

## NOTE - After running NPM install, vue project would not compile due to issues with bootstrap-vue.  You may need to run this seperately:
```
npm i vue bootstrap-vue bootstrap


```
## Another build error was resolved by running the following:
```
npm i vue-template-compiler --save-dev
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

```
npm run lint
```
